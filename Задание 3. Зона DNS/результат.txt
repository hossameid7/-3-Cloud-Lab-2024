Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

╷
│ Warning: Incomplete lock file information for providers
│
│ Due to your customized provider installation methods, Terraform was forced to calculate lock file checksums locally
│ for the following providers:
│   - yandex-cloud/yandex
│
│ The current .terraform.lock.hcl file only includes checksums for windows_amd64, so Terraform running on another
│ platform will fail to install these providers.
│
│ To calculate additional checksums for another platform, run:
│   terraform providers lock -platform=linux_amd64
│ (where linux_amd64 is the platform to generate)

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
PS C:\Users\Hossam\terraform\yandex-dns> terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:
